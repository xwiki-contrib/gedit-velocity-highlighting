gedit-velocity-highlighting
===========================

Color highlighting to support the Velocity Syntax in gEdit. Forked from Devon P. Hubner since his website is not available anymore.

It actually works with every editor based on GTKSourceView.

How to install
====

Copy `velocity.lang` into `~/.local/share/gtksourceview-2.0/language-specs` or into `/usr/share/gtksourceview-2.0/language-specs/`. Restart gEdit. That's it!

The velocity syntax is associated to the `.vm` extension.
